# Advent of Code 2022

Having a crack at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in 2022.

Let's see how we go, I usually give up after two or three, and to be honest I'm rather busy at the moment!

I am going to attempt this year's problems in vanilla TypeScript, as an exercise in validating I know how to do things in that language without an overcooked web framework.


## Running these solutions

Use the `solve` script with the Day as an argument (after `--` to pass it through correctly).

Example for Day 1:

```
$ npm run solve -- 1

> advent2022@0.1.0 solve
> node --no-warnings --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --loader ts-node/esm solve.ts 1
